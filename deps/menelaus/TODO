----------- to discuss with Matt/Rod ------
* (low priority) don't use hardcoded uris for alerts, settings & logs
   as we do now

* 'edit bucket cache size' needs design as well as REST API design &
   implementation.

* There's also comments in server sources about using bucket uri PUT for
   password changes. Another notable point here is use of JSON.

-------------------------------------------
* there is also some hook.js rotation bug or (worse) SamplesRestorer
   bug, as rotation is not perfect sometimes
* clicking on small graphs doesn't always work. Probably due to
   concurrent graph refresh.
* be consistent with respect to URI versus URL

NOW

* 'cluster memory available' for bucket creation
* edit cache sz (no design!)

LATER

* sorting on buckets list
* Escape key handling for closing dialogs (broken due to jqModal)
* find out what's causing IE leaks
