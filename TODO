----------- to discuss with Matt/Rod ------
* (low priority) don't use hardcoded uris for alerts, settings & logs
   as we do now

* "Cluster Disk Usage" should be "Cluster Cache Allocated" (spec or
   server-side implementation is needed)

* I made 'Configure view' work in instant-apply mode, which is
   possible due to client-side storage of this prefs. And I assume
   that it's better from usability standpoint. OK ?

* list of statistics on 'Configure View' should be adjusted to match
   actually produced stats

-------------------------------------------

* there is also some hook.js rotation bug or (worse) SamplesRestorer
   bug, as rotation is not perfect sometimes
* clicking on small graphs doesn't always work. Probably due to
   concurrent graph refresh.
* be consistent with respect to URI versus URL

NOW

o [DONE] allow no auth for login
o [DONE] configure view
o [DONE] log for alerts section
* not reloading app after cluster join and displaying success
   indicator on overview

* fix ugliness of analytics graphs
* xx nodes last collected ?? secs ago on analytics
* 'cluster memory available' for bucket creation

o [DONE] cookies for login credentials
* edit cache sz (no design!)
o [DONE] sign-out

LATER

* sorting on buckets list
* Escape key handling for closing dialogs (broken due to jqModal)


Items to be completed.  Listed in only-web when mocked up/working
there, listed in Menelaus when wired in.

CLUSTER OVERVIEW
* 'Get Started' section
o [DONE] no node list
o [DONE] correct fields in node list on overview page (done for OS and 
  version, need REST response for memory)
o [DONE] expandable node list in overview status
* leave cluster
* Wire up memory usage and cache allocated

* (Andrew) Accordion for nodes should allow multiple to be open at the same time

POOL ANALYTICS UI
* ???? Have the zoom level show the right thing

ERROR HANDLING
* ???? (low priority) serve up customized 404 and 500 pages

* complete API switch to camelCase by converting all parameter names
   [DONE] [alk: not quite. Several query params are still underscore-styled]
