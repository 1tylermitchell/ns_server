o [DONE] switching between buckets & pools
* bucket name in top key values UI
o [DONE] switching graphs on overview
o [DONE] marks and labels on graphs (jquery sparklines seem inappropriate)
* API for rest of sections
* tests via watir
* welcome screen
o [DONE] respect interval select for all sub-sections
* Store password/login in cookies ? So that you don't have to re-enter
   them on page refresh.
* samples_interval for stats response should be in milliseconds, just
   like tstamp.

* failure to retreive stats after switch to another zoom leaves us
   stale data (showing data for previous zoom)

* intelligent circuit breaker for ajax requests
