* there is also some hook.js rotation bug or (worse) SamplesRestorer
   bug, as rotation is not perfect sometimes

CONSOLE LOGIN
* (re)implement

ADD BUCKET

* Store password/login in cookies ? So that you don't have to re-enter
   them on page refresh.

o [DONE] failure to retreive stats after switch to another zoom leaves us
   stale data (showing data for previous zoom)
* leaving 'overview' section should disable polling of stats. Or maybe
   don't bother ?

* intelligent circuit breaker for ajax requests
* complete API switch to camelCase by converting all parameter names
   [DONE] [alk: not quite. Several query params are still underscore-styled]
* loading indicator for alert settings form
