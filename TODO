----------- to discuss with Matt/Rod ------
* (low priority) don't use hardcoded uris for alerts, settings & logs
   as we do now

* "Cluster Disk Usage" should be "Cluster Cache Allocated" (spec or
   server-side implementation is needed)

* list of statistics on 'Configure View' should be adjusted to match
   actually produced stats

* 'edit bucket cache size' needs design as well as REST API design &
   implementation.

* There's also comments in server sources about using bucket uri PUT for
   password changes. Another notable point here is use of JSON.

-------------------------------------------
* there is also some hook.js rotation bug or (worse) SamplesRestorer
   bug, as rotation is not perfect sometimes
* clicking on small graphs doesn't always work. Probably due to
   concurrent graph refresh.
* be consistent with respect to URI versus URL

NOW

o [DONE] allow no auth for login
o [DONE] configure view
o [DONE] log for alerts section
* not reloading app after cluster join and displaying success
   indicator on overview

o [DONE] fix ugliness of analytics graphs
* render pix-perfect graphs
o [DONE] xx nodes last collected ?? secs ago on analytics
* 'cluster memory available' for bucket creation

o [DONE] cookies for login credentials
* edit cache sz (no design!)
o [DONE] sign-out
* wire markup for cluster leave confirmation
o [DONE] make breadcrumbs work

* (Andrew) Accordion for nodes should allow multiple to be open at the same time

LATER

* sorting on buckets list
* Escape key handling for closing dialogs (broken due to jqModal)
* find out what's causing IE leaks

Items to be completed.  Listed in only-web when mocked up/working
there, listed in Menelaus when wired in.
