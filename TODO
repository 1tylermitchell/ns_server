* there is also some hook.js rotation bug or (worse) SamplesRestorer
   bug, as rotation is not perfect sometimes
* clicking on small graphs doesn't always work. Probably due to
   concurrent graph refresh.
* I need 'Cluster Memory Available' for 'Add New Bucket' dialog
o [DONE] implement ModalAction
* be consistent with respect to URI versus URL

Items to be completed.  Listed in only-web when mocked up/working
there, listed in Menelaus when wired in.

 --------------------------------------------------------------


CLUSTER OVERVIEW
* 'Get Started' section
o [DONE] no node list
* correct fields in node list on overview page (done for OS and 
  version, need REST response for memory)
o [DONE] expandable node list in overview status
* leave cluster
* "Cluster Disk Usage" should be "Cluster Cache Allocated"
* Wire up memory usage and cache allocated

POOL ANALYTICS UI
* Remove the 24 Hour zoom level

BUCKETS UI
o [DONE] (re)implement
o [DONE] prepare new API to mass-fetch bucket details with support for pagination
o [DONE] mass bucket stats for buckets section
o [DROPPED for now] pagination
* implement sorting
* implement link to bucket analytics (works)

BUCKET PROPERTIES UI
o [DONE] basic
* remove bucket
o [DONE] flush all
o [DONE] change password
* implement REST server side 

TEST APPLICATION BUCKET
* implement

CONFIGURE THIS VIEW (graphs view configuration)
* implement

JOIN CLUSTER
* implement

ALERTS
* implement dismiss via client filtering (though REST would
  be better)
* log

CLUSTER SETTINGS
* base UI
* security
* web address/port
* proxy/cache port config (advanced)
* alert mail settings
* alert types settings

CONSOLE LOGIN
* implement the new login screen (as seen in the artwork assets and the
  mockingbird mock ups) with a cookie to recall previous login.  Also
  implement logout.

ADD BUCKET
o [DONE] implement (with button on BUCKET PROPERTIES section)
* fix ?? in Total Cluster Memory estimation in creation form
* implement server side

ERROR HANDLING
o [DONE] actually reload the page when an error occurs; right now a dialog is displayed
* (low priority) serve up customized 404 and 500 pages

* complete API switch to camelCase by converting all parameter names
   [DONE] [alk: not quite. Several query params are still underscore-styled]
* loading indicator for alert settings form
