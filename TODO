* there is also some hook.js rotation bug or (worse) SamplesRestorer
   bug, as rotation is not perfect sometimes
* clicking on small graphs doesn't always work. Probably due to
   concurrent graph refresh.

o [DONE] failure to retreive stats after switch to another zoom leaves us
   stale data (showing data for previous zoom)

   don't bother ?
