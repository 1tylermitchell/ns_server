o [DONE] switching between buckets & pools
o [DONE] bucket name in top key values UI
o [DONE] switching graphs on overview
o [DONE] marks and labels on graphs (jquery sparklines seem inappropriate)
o [DONE] alerts section implementation
** refresh
** editable email setting
* alerts section log tab
o [DONE] proper tstamp formatting for alerts
* server settings implementation
* tests via watir
* welcome screen
o [DONE] respect interval select for all sub-sections

* Store password/login in cookies ? So that you don't have to re-enter
   them on page refresh.
* samples_interval for stats response should be in milliseconds, just
   like tstamp.

o [DONE] failure to retreive stats after switch to another zoom leaves us
   stale data (showing data for previous zoom)
* leaving 'overview' section should disable polling of stats. Or maybe
   don't bother ?

* intelligent circuit breaker for ajax requests
* complete API switch to camelCase by converting all parameter names
* loading indicator for alert settings form
